# pig-game

This repository is the implementation for the dice game in the article [Zhu, T., Ma, M., Chen, L., & Liu, Z. (2023). Optimal Strategy of the Simultaneous Dice Game Pig for Multiplayers: When Reinforcement Learning Meets Game Theory](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-2433678/v1/0c1118c9def6de3204b99638.pdf?c=1674444450).

We design 3 different difficulties and 2 different modes, sequential and simultaneous, respectively. Please feel free to play the game!
